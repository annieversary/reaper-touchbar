# reaper-touchbar

adds touchbar support to reaper. [demo video on twitter](https://twitter.com/_annieversary/status/1612130651985137666)

this project has been abandoned. work decided to upgrade my laptop so i no longer have a touchbar, and therefore can't (and don't care) to keep working on this. 
feel free to use this as a base if you want to start working on this.
the code is probably not great and poorly documented, but hey it kinda worked.
